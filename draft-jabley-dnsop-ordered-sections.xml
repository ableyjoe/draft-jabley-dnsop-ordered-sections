    <abstract>
      <t>The existing Domain Name System (DNS) specifications lack
	some clarity in their description of the process by which
	individual sections of a DNS message are constructed.</t>

      <t>This document updates RFC 1034 and RFC 1035 to provide
	a clearer specification, consistent with deployed
	implementations.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document uses terminology specific to the Domain Name
        System (DNS), descriptions of which can be found in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-terminology"/>.</t>

      <t>In an exchange of DNS messages between two hosts, this document
        refers to the host sending a DNS request as the initiator, and
        the host sending a DNS response as the responder.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY"
        and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>


    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC1034"/> specifies an algorithm for use by
	responders when constructing a DNS response. This algorithm
	in some cases can result in multiple RRSets being included
	in a single section of a DNS message, e.g. when handling
	CNAME resource records.</t>

      <t>Most responder implementations [citation needed] have
	interpreted the direction to copy or store particular RRSets
	in sections of a DNS response to mean "append", treating
	each section as an ordered list of RRSets.  Some initiators
	[citation needed] are known to rely upon that interpretation when
        processing DNS responses received from responders.</t>

      <t>This document updates <xref target="RFC1035"/> to specify
	that every section in a DNS message is an ordered list of
	RRSets, and clarifies the directions provided in <xref
	target="RFC1034"/> to match the observed behaviour and
	expectations of deployed software.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Updates to RFC 1034" anchor="algorithm">
      <t><xref target="RFC1034"/> specifies the algorithms by which
	sections of a DNS response are constructed by a responder.
	For example, step 3 of the algorithm described in <xref
	target="RFC1034"/> section 4.3.2 contains the direction
	"copy all RRs which match QTYPE into answer section".</t>

      <t>In this case, and in all other cases where <xref
	target="RFC1034"/> specifies that particular RRSets be
	included in a section of a DNS message, the section MUST
	be treated as an ordered list of RRSets. When it is necessary
	to include new RRSets in a section of a DNS message that
	is under construction, those RRSets MUST be appended.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Updates to RFC 1035">
      <t>In a DNS message, every section MUST be considered to be
        an ordered set of RRSets.</t>

      <t>DNS responders MUST construct each section in a DNS response
	according to the algorithms specified in <xref target="RFC1034"/>,
	as clarified in <xref target="algorithm"/> of this document.</t>

        known security implications.</t>
