               Ordering of RRSets in DNS Message Sections
                 draft-jabley-dnsop-ordered-sections-00

Abstract

   The existing Domain Name System (DNS) specifications lack some
   clarity in their description of the process by which individual
   sections of a DNS message are constructed.

   This document updates RFC 1034 and RFC 1035 to provide a clearer
   specification, consistent with deployed implementations.

1.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to the Domain Name System
   (DNS), descriptions of which can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-terminology].

   In an exchange of DNS messages between two hosts, this document
   refers to the host sending a DNS request as the initiator, and the
   host sending a DNS response as the responder.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   [RFC1034] specifies an algorithm for use by responders when
   constructing a DNS response.  This algorithm in some cases can result
   in multiple RRSets being included in a single section of a DNS
   message, e.g. when handling CNAME resource records.

   Most responder implementations [citation needed] have interpreted the
   direction to copy or store particular RRSets in sections of a DNS
   response to mean "append", treating each section as an ordered list
   of RRSets.  Some initiators [citation needed] are known to rely upon
   that interpretation when processing DNS responses received from
   responders.

   This document updates [RFC1035] to specify that every section in a
   DNS message is an ordered list of RRSets, and clarifies the
   directions provided in [RFC1034] to match the observed behaviour and
   expectations of deployed software.

3.  Updates to RFC 1034

   [RFC1034] specifies the algorithms by which sections of a DNS
   response are constructed by a responder.  For example, step 3 of the
   algorithm described in [RFC1034] section 4.3.2 contains the direction
   "copy all RRs which match QTYPE into answer section".

   In this case, and in all other cases where [RFC1034] specifies that
   particular RRSets be included in a section of a DNS message, the
   section MUST be treated as an ordered list of RRSets.  When it is
   necessary to include new RRSets in a section of a DNS message that is
   under construction, those RRSets MUST be appended.

4.  Updates to RFC 1035

   In a DNS message, every section MUST be considered to be an ordered
   set of RRSets.

   DNS responders MUST construct each section in a DNS response
   according to the algorithms specified in [RFC1034], as clarified in
   Section 3 of this document.
